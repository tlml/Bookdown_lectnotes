============

Some text...

Removing the label that doesn't do anything, and adding Rbookdown label
\begin{equation}
  \int_1^2 x^2\sin(x) dx
  (\#eq:integral)
\end{equation}

This equation is Equation \@ref(eq:integral).

If you are using pandoc-eqnos extension (needs to be installed, check at https://github.com/tomduck/pandoc-eqnos, and activated in _output.yml), the following will also work:

$$
  \int_1^2 x^2\sin(x) dx$$ {#eq:integraltoo}

which will be referenced as Equation ({@eq:integraltoo}).

Note: it's either or for the whole document, NOT mixed!

![This will be the label and alt-text](dl-logo-black.jpg){width=".7\linewidth"}

More control for images can be done with knitr:

```{r knitr-logo, out.width='32.8%', fig.show='hold', fig.cap='Two logos side by side', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep('dl-logo-black.jpg', 2))
```

The caption/title and the alt-text are still the same though.. There is a way to get around it, TBD.
